description: 'Data released here is for archival purposes. The recommended route for
  interacting with these data is through the AllenSDK (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK/)
  which provides methods for downloading and processing data. Documentation of the
  AllenSDK can be found here: https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Full documentation
  of the Visual Behavior Ophys dataset and tutorials can be found here: https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_behavior_optical_physiology.html


  The Visual Behavior Ophys dataset was generated using in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging
  (also called optical physiology, or “ophys”) to measure the activity of genetically
  identified neurons in the visual cortex of mice performing a go/no-go visual change
  detection task. The same population of neurons was recorded over multiple days with
  varying sensory and behavioral contexts, including familiar and novel stimuli, and
  passive exposure sessions. This dataset can be used to evaluate the influence of
  experience, expectation, and task engagement on neural coding and dynamics in excitatory
  and inhibitory cell populations.


  The full ophys dataset includes neural and behavioral measurements from 107 well-trained
  mice during 703 in vivo 2-photon imaging sessions from 326 unique fields of view,
  resulting in a total of 50,476 cortical neurons recorded.


  The full behavioral training history of all imaged mice is also provided as part
  of the dataset, allowing investigation into task learning, behavioral strategy,
  and inter-animal variability. There are a total of 4,782 behavior sessions available
  for analysis.


  There are useful summary metadata tables that are unavailable in this datasets.
  Use the AllenSDK to download these Pandas/csv tables. See this notebook (https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_ophys_data_access.html)
  for information on downloading these data and the associated NWB files.'
